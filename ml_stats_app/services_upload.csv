1,Linear Regression,"Performs linear regression analysis to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. This algorithm is useful for understanding the relationship between variables and making predictions.","Columns: X, Y","Predict sales based on advertising spend, Forecast revenue based on past trends, Estimate housing prices based on features",ML
2,Logistic Regression,"Performs logistic regression analysis to classify binary outcomes. It is widely used for scenarios where you need to predict the probability of an event occurring.","Columns: X, Y","Classify customer churn, Predict disease presence based on symptoms, Determine email spam likelihood",ML
3,K-Means Clustering,"Clusters data into k groups based on feature similarity. This unsupervised learning technique helps in segmenting data into meaningful clusters.","Columns: Features","Segment customers into groups, Group similar products together, Identify patterns in user behavior",ML
4,Decision Trees,"Builds decision tree models for classification or regression tasks. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to interpret.","Columns: Features, Target","Predict loan defaults, Classify customer segments, Forecast product demand",ML
5,Random Forest,"Builds random forest models by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. Useful for both classification and regression tasks.","Columns: Features, Target","Predict customer retention, Classify transaction fraud, Forecast weather conditions",ML
6,Mean Calculation,"Calculates the mean of a dataset to find the average value. Useful for summarizing data and identifying central tendencies.","Columns: Data","Analyze average sales, Calculate mean test scores, Determine average customer rating",Stat
7,Median Calculation,"Calculates the median of a dataset, which represents the middle value. Median is useful for understanding the central point of skewed distributions.","Columns: Data","Analyze median income, Determine median house price, Calculate median age of a population",Stat
8,Standard Deviation,"Calculates the standard deviation to measure the dispersion of data from the mean. It helps in understanding variability within a dataset.","Columns: Data","Analyze variability in sales, Measure spread of test scores, Determine consistency in manufacturing processes",Stat
9,Variance Calculation,"Calculates the variance of a dataset, indicating the degree of spread. Variance is important for statistical analyses and risk assessment.","Columns: Data","Analyze variance in product prices, Assess financial risk, Measure variability in survey responses",Stat
10,Correlation Analysis,"Performs correlation analysis to identify relationships between two variables. Correlation helps in understanding how changes in one variable affect another.","Columns: Variable1, Variable2","Find correlations between marketing spend and sales, Analyze relationship between temperature and energy consumption, Determine association between exercise and health outcomes",Stat
11,ANOVA,"Performs ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to compare means across multiple groups. ANOVA is used to identify significant differences between groups.","Columns: Group, Value","Compare sales across different regions, Test effectiveness of different marketing strategies, Analyze variance in production output across shifts",Stat
12,Chi-Square Test,"Performs chi-square test to analyze categorical data and test for independence or goodness of fit. It helps in understanding relationships between categorical variables.","Columns: Category, Count","Analyze customer preferences, Test independence of survey responses, Assess effectiveness of marketing campaigns",Stat
13,T-Test,"Performs t-test analysis to compare means between two groups. T-tests are used to determine if there are significant differences between groups.","Columns: Group, Value","Compare mean test scores between two classes, Analyze average sales before and after a promotion, Assess effectiveness of a new drug",Stat
14,Linear Regression,"Performs linear regression analysis to predict continuous outcomes based on input features. This algorithm is useful for understanding the relationship between variables and making predictions.","Columns: X, Y","Predict sales based on advertising spend, Forecast revenue based on past trends, Estimate housing prices based on features",Stat
15,Time Series Analysis,"Performs time series analysis to analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. It is useful for forecasting and identifying trends over time.","Columns: Date, Value","Forecast future sales, Analyze stock market trends, Predict energy consumption patterns",Stat
