Project Overview:
The project involves creating a system that predicts future sales based
on historical data and optimizes inventory levels to ensure the right
products are available at the right time, minimizing overstock and stockouts.

Key Features:

Data Ingestion and Cleaning:

Import sales data from various sources (e.g., CSV, databases).
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
Sales Forecasting:

Use machine learning algorithms to predict future sales.
Implement time series analysis for accurate forecasting.
Inventory Optimization:

Calculate optimal inventory levels based on forecasted sales.
Generate reorder alerts when inventory levels are low.
Dashboard for Monitoring:

Create an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends, inventory levels, and forecast accuracy.
Provide insights and actionable recommendations.
Automation and Scheduling:

Automate data ingestion, cleaning, and forecasting processes.
Schedule regular updates to ensure the system remains up-to-date.
