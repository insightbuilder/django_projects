- Create environment    
    * create virtual environment using python -m venv djangopjts
    * activate it using djangopjts\Scripts\activate
    * do pip install httpie django 
- Create Django Project, and Django app. Keep the same name every time you run this warmup
    * project: recap

    * Create the urls.py file in app
    * Update the urls.py file in project along with the path
    * Start working with Views.py using the HttpResponse to begin with.
    (No rendering to the front-end)
- Complete CRED operation API calls using django, and steadily extend the app to 
    include further ideas related to LLMs.
        - simple get, no query params
            * http GET :8000/reapp/
            * http GET :8000/reapp/get_name/ name==nice
        - simple get with idx 
            * http GET :8000/reapp/get_idx/1
        - get with single and multi-query params
            * http GET :8000/reapp/mqp/ name==nice age==2
        - simple post with idx 
            * http POST :8000/reapp/post_idx/1
        - post with key-value
            * http -f POST :8000/reapp/post_multi/ name=superawesome age=25
        - put with key-value
            * http PUT :8000/reapp/put_name/ name=superawesome age=36
        - put with url idx
            * http PUT :8000/reapp/put_name_url/1 
        - del with url idx
            * http DEL :8000/reapp/put_name_url/1
    - Was thinking of creating a video that provides the above end points, 
    and include the database connectivity also.
        - post task to task table in database
            * http -f POST :8000/reapp/post_task/ title="task1" description="super task" category=1
        - retrieve all tasks with get
            * http :8000/reapp/atasks/
        - retrieve one task
            * http :8000/reapp/onetask/3
    - Adding relationship between the multiple tables and retrieving them
        * When creating ForeignKey and makingmigrations, django will complain 
        that owner field cannot be empty. Choose the 2nd option to provide 
        default value in models.py and it will proceed to make the migrations.
        - add owners
            - http -f POST :8000/reapp/regowner/ name=owner1 age=25 mail_id=owner1@localhost
        - add tasks
            - http -f POST :8000/reapp/post_task/ owner=owner1 title=task1 description="major task 1" category=0  
            * when using the get_object_or_404, the return is a list, so subscript it with [0]
        - retrieve tasks that belong to a owner
    - Updating the owner name / email_id
        > http PUT :8000/ra/updt_owner/ name=owner2 mail_id=sec_owner@hotspot.com
    - Delete the owner based on owner name
        > http :8000/ra/del_owner/owner2/
            * The url path path('del_owner/<str:owner>/', del_owner, name='del_owner'),
            The <str:owner>/ has to contain the trailing /, else it will not work.
    - Update the Task desc or Task title
    - Delete the task based on the task Id
    - Adding support for complex activities.
        - Posting the HF ml-models repo path
